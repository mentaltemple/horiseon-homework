## Description
* I refactored this site to make it cleaner and more accessible
* This makes the Horiseon website more accessible for people who use screen readers
* I learned how to properly organize the html document using semantic tags, replacing "div" tags with "section", "nav", "footer", etc.
* I added alt descriptors to all photos 
* I ensured that all header tags follow a sequential order from top to bottom

## Usage
